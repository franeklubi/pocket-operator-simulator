* **Please bear in mind that this is not an official teenage engineering product.**
* **This will not and does not replace the original TE's PO-20**
* **This is not, at all, perfect 1:1 copy**
* **It doesn't include every feature of TE's PO-20**
* **I am not, in any way, affiliated with teenage engineering or Cheap Monday**


This is a simulation of the teenage engineering's pocket operator PO-20.

Written just for fun using the p5js library with sound and dom extensions.

For timing, I used [mrchimp's Tock.js](https://github.com/mrchimp/tock) library.

Be free to use this **code** for any purpose.


# Neat features #

* **you can drop your samples on any of the sequencer buttons**
* currently playing chord can be seen on the screen
* works on phone too, a bit slowly though
* you can pan every sample
* full automation support
* you will be able to chain more than standard PO's 128 patterns
* it's cool
* you can use your keyboard to play with it, here's a keymap:

### Not that neat features

* all the effects are gone. Maybe they'll be there in the future but I doubt that
* the Sounds #0, #8, #9, #10 won't follow root note of currently playing chord
